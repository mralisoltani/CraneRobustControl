# CraneRobustControl

presents a robust controller designing procedure of an over-head crane using D-K iteration method

In this paper like report, I have presented a robust controller designing procedure of an over-head crane using some robust control methods.
H-infinity and D-K iteration are well considered in this project.
Matlab and Simulink Files are also available.

Good Luck All.
